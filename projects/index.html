	<h2>Research Summary</h2>
      </header>
      <p> Abstract - Since graduating from Boston University in the spring of 2016, I have been working at Snapdragon Chemistry, Inc., a company dedicated to delivering innovative solutions to problems in synthetic process chemistry through continuous flow technology. During my undergraduate research career, I worked with Prof. James Panek on both total synthesis and asymmetric catalysis. In this summary, I will present my academic research conducted at BU as well as an example from Snapdragon. </p>
      <h3>Accessing Trifluoromethyl Radical via Charge Transfer Intermediate: An Alternative Trifluoromethylation Pathway (Snapdragon Chemistry, Inc.)</h3>
      <p> The advantages of performing continuous flow over traditional batch chemistry are perhaps most dramatically demonstrated during photochemical reactions. High surface area to volume ratios ensure greatest photon exposure, resulting in greater efficiency and throughput compared to traditional batch. At Snapdragon Chemistry, we often construct custom photochemical reactors. During the summer of 2016, we decided to use a well known photoredox catalyzed trifluoromethylation reported by <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8919">Stephenson</a> in order to establish the efficiency of these reactors. This particular reaction takes advantage of inexpensive reagents to generate a redox active ester, which, following reduction by photoexcited Ru(bpy)3Cl2, generates CF3 radical via  a decarboxylative pathway. Radical condensation with an aromatic ring yields the trifluoromethylated arene.
	  We began by conducting residence time experiments in flow using electron rich 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (DMB) as the arene starting material. These experiments determined that the reaction rate was somewhat independent of catalyst loading and did not strictly follow the expected zero-order reaction kinetic profile (Figure 1). We were surprised to see that the reaction rate of the control experiment ( 0 mol % cat.) was quite competitive to that of the catalyzed version and postulated the existence of an alternative radical pathway with a charge transfer (CT) complex intermediate between DMB and the electron poor pyridinium intermediate. A modified Benessi-Hildebrand analysis of the proposed host-guest interaction revealed an association constant of 2.17, confirming our suspicion. With this information, we proposed a reaction mechanism with a CT intermediate (Figure 2). Results from exploration of the substrate scope suggest that equilibrium concentration of the CT complex is dependant on the electron-rich character of the arene. At the end of this project, the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929416301048">Stephenson</a> group reported a mechanism that is very similar to our own conclusions. Nonetheless, we independently discovered, and gathered support for this unique mode of reactivity.</p>

            <p>This project seeks to addres the security concerns specific to bare metal clouds. We use a TPM as a hardware root of trust and measure each step of the boot process along with the machine's firmare before booting the client's image or attaching their storage. If the values in the TPM's registers do not match those on a whitelist, the machine will not finish booting and encryption keys to the client's stroage will not be releassed.</p>

      <h3>Cloud Side Channels</h3>
      <p>Side channels become a problem whenever there is shared hardware. HIL avoids most traditional side channels by giving tenants an entrire physical machine, but some of the network infrastructure is still shared between tenants.</p>

            <h4>Network Flooding</h4>
            <p>This project seeks to exploit shared network infrastructure by using an observed attacker bandwidth to determine victim activity. Initially it focused of virtualized instances colocated on the same MOC node. These instances share a physical NIC so an attacker that is able to consume all the avialable bandwith out of the node is able to observe when a colocated victim begins sending packets through the corresponding drop in their own bandwidth.</p>
