	<h2>Research Summary</h2>
      </header>
      <p> Abstract - Since graduating from Boston University in the spring of 2016, I have been working at Snapdragon Chemistry, Inc., a company dedicated to delivering innovative solutions to problems in synthetic process chemistry through continuous flow technology. During my undergraduate research career, I worked with Prof. James Panek on both total synthesis and asymmetric catalysis. In this summary, I will present my academic research conducted at BU as well as an example from Snapdragon. </p>
      <h3>Accessing Trifluoromethyl Radical via Charge Transfer Intermediate: An Alternative Trifluoromethylation Pathway (Snapdragon Chemistry, Inc.)</h3>
      <p> The advantages of performing continuous flow over traditional batch chemistry are perhaps most dramatically demonstrated during photochemical reactions. High surface area to volume ratios ensure greatest photon exposure, resulting in greater efficiency and throughput compared to traditional batch. At Snapdragon Chemistry, we often construct custom photochemical reactors. During the summer of 2016, we decided to use a well known photoredox catalyzed trifluoromethylation reported by <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8919">Stephenson</a> in order to establish the efficiency of these reactors. This particular reaction takes advantage of inexpensive reagents to generate a redox active ester, which, following reduction by photoexcited Ru(bpy)3Cl2, generates CF3 radical via  a decarboxylative pathway. Radical condensation with an aromatic ring yields the trifluoromethylated arene. </p>

      <p> We began by conducting residence time experiments in flow using electron rich 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (DMB) as the arene starting material. These experiments determined that the reaction rate was somewhat independent of catalyst loading and did not strictly follow the expected zero-order reaction kinetic profile (Figure 1). We were surprised to see that the reaction rate of the control experiment ( 0 mol % cat.) was quite competitive to that of the catalyzed version and postulated the existence of an alternative radical pathway with a charge transfer (CT) complex intermediate between DMB and the electron poor pyridinium intermediate. A modified Benessi-Hildebrand analysis of the proposed host-guest interaction revealed an association constant of 2.17, confirming our suspicion. With this information, we proposed a reaction mechanism with a CT intermediate (Figure 2). Results from exploration of the substrate scope suggest that equilibrium concentration of the CT complex is dependant on the electron-rich character of the arene. At the end of this project, the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929416301048">Stephenson</a> group reported a mechanism that is very similar to our own conclusions. Nonetheless, we independently discovered, and gathered support for this unique mode of reactivity.</p>

      <h3>Diastereoselective cyclopropanation of Allenylsilanes with Transfer of Axial Chirality (Boston University)</h3>
      <p> In the spring of my senior year, I proposed and pursued the catalytic cyclopropanation of allenylsilanes with diazoacetates affording alkylidene cyclopropanes (ACPs). ACPs are frequently utilized synthetic intermediates, serving as precursors to biologically significant molecules. Cyclopropanation of allenes with diazo species is typically employed to access ACPs, but current methods often suffer from a lack of regioselectivity and respond poorly to densely substituted allenes. It was hypothesized that a significant beta-silicone effect present in allenylsilanes would overcome these limitations. Investigations began by synthesizing Ru(II)-Pheox, a  non-commercially available chiral catalyst reported by the Iwasa group. This catalyst was chosen based on reported use in similar applications - for a comprehensive overview of the catalyst, I direct the reader to a recent review published by <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00070">Iwasa</a>. Benzyl diazoacetate was easily generated in two steps from benzyl alcohol and bromoacetyl bromide according to <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ol701432k">Fukuyama</a>.</p>

      <p>Initial reaction optimization was performed on achiral allenes of the type shown in Table 1. Cyclization about the unsubstituted olefin occurred exclusively; the other possible regioisomer was not detected upon 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture. It is likely that the observed regioselectivity was a result of both the beta-Si effect and the silane group providing steric protection of the internal olefin. It is worth noting that the enantioselectivity and E/Z selectivity slightly decreased when changing the silane group from SiMe2Ph to SiMe3 while the yield consistently increased. This immediately suggested a mode of reactivity - steric bulk of the silane was responsible for providing a biased approach to the Ru reaction site, giving rise to a greater e.r. in the case of SiMe2Ph. However, the SiMe3 allene was better able to access the congested reaction center, compete with the rate of dimeric diazoacetate byproduct formation, and ultimately achieve a higher yield. </p>

      <p>With encouraging initial results, this project could be continued in a number of ways. For example, the substrate scope of the allenylsilane and diazoacetate components could be further explored, and the electronic properties of the phenyl ring in the Ru\textsuperscript{II}-Pheox could be modulated via substitution to better align with this particular reaction. This project was inherited by a graduate student in the Panek lab and is ongoing.</p>

      <h3>Asymmetric Propargylation of Carbonyls (Boston University)</h3>
      <p> In the fall of my senior year, I independently worked on developing a catalytic asymmetric propargylation of allenylsilanes. The allenylsilane reagents developed by the Panek group have a reactivity-enhancing beta-Si group, which results in greater electron density and enhanced nucleophilicity of the alleneâ€™s terminal olefin. The goal was to produce enantioenriched propargylic alcohols from achiral allenylsilanes in the presence of a transition metal Lewis acid and a chiral ligand. The project was initiated by screening Pybox ligands with Sc(OTf)3 in the reaction of achiral allenysilanes with ethyl glyoxalate. </p>
