	<h2>Research Summary</h2>
      </header>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p> Since graduating from Boston University in the spring of 2016, I have been working at Snapdragon Chemistry, Inc., a company dedicated to delivering innovative solutions to problems in synthetic process chemistry through continuous flow technology. During my undergraduate research career, I worked with Prof. James Panek on both total synthesis and asymmetric catalysis. In this summary, I will present my academic research conducted at BU as well as an example from Snapdragon. </p>
      <h3>Accessing Trifluoromethyl Radical via Charge Transfer Intermediate: An Alternative Trifluoromethylation Pathway (Snapdragon Chemistry, Inc.)</h3>
      <p> The advantages of performing continuous flow over traditional batch chemistry are perhaps most dramatically demonstrated during photochemical reactions. High surface area to volume ratios ensure greatest photon exposure, resulting in greater efficiency and throughput compared to traditional batch. At Snapdragon Chemistry, we often construct custom photochemical reactors. During the summer of 2016, we decided to use a well known photoredox catalyzed trifluoromethylation reported by <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8919">Stephenson</a> in order to establish the efficiency of these reactors. This particular reaction takes advantage of inexpensive reagents to generate a redox active ester, which, following reduction by photoexcited Ru(bpy)3Cl2, generates CF3 radical via  a decarboxylative pathway. Radical condensation with an aromatic ring yields the trifluoromethylated arene. </p>

      <p> We began by conducting residence time experiments in flow using electron rich 1,4-dimethoxybenzene (DMB) as the arene starting material. These experiments determined that the reaction rate was somewhat independent of catalyst loading and did not strictly follow the expected zero-order reaction kinetic profile (Figure 1). We were surprised to see that the reaction rate of the control experiment ( 0 mol % cat.) was quite competitive to that of the catalyzed version and postulated the existence of an alternative radical pathway with a charge transfer (CT) complex intermediate between DMB and the electron poor pyridinium intermediate. A modified Benessi-Hildebrand analysis of the proposed host-guest interaction revealed an association constant of 2.17, confirming our suspicion. With this information, we proposed a reaction mechanism with a CT intermediate (Figure 2). Results from exploration of the substrate scope suggest that equilibrium concentration of the CT complex is dependant on the electron-rich character of the arene. At the end of this project, the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929416301048">Stephenson</a> group reported a mechanism that is very similar to our own conclusions. Nonetheless, we independently discovered, and gathered support for this unique mode of reactivity.</p>

      <h3>Diastereoselective Cyclopropanation of Allenylsilanes with Transfer of Axial Chirality (Boston University)</h3>
      <p> In the spring of my senior year, I proposed and pursued the catalytic cyclopropanation of allenylsilanes with diazoacetates affording alkylidene cyclopropanes (ACPs). ACPs are frequently utilized synthetic intermediates, serving as precursors to biologically significant molecules. Cyclopropanation of allenes with diazo species is typically employed to access ACPs, but current methods often suffer from a lack of regioselectivity and respond poorly to densely substituted allenes. It was hypothesized that a significant beta-silicone effect present in allenylsilanes would overcome these limitations. Investigations began by synthesizing Ru(II)-Pheox, a  non-commercially available chiral catalyst reported by the Iwasa group. This catalyst was chosen based on reported use in similar applications - for a comprehensive overview of the catalyst, I direct the reader to a recent review published by <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00070">Iwasa</a>. Benzyl diazoacetate was easily generated in two steps from benzyl alcohol and bromoacetyl bromide according to <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ol701432k">Fukuyama</a>.</p>

      <p>Initial reaction optimization was performed on achiral allenes of the type shown in Table 1. Cyclization about the unsubstituted olefin occurred exclusively; the other possible regioisomer was not detected upon 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixture. It is likely that the observed regioselectivity was a result of both the beta-Si effect and the silane group providing steric protection of the internal olefin. It is worth noting that the enantioselectivity and E/Z selectivity slightly decreased when changing the silane group from SiMe2Ph to SiMe3 while the yield consistently increased. This immediately suggested a mode of reactivity - steric bulk of the silane was responsible for providing a biased approach to the Ru reaction site, giving rise to a greater e.r. in the case of SiMe2Ph. However, the SiMe3 allene was better able to access the congested reaction center, compete with the rate of dimeric diazoacetate byproduct formation, and ultimately achieve a higher yield. </p>

      <p>Knowing that the SiMe3 allenylsilane may be better suited to this catalyst system, I sought to determine whether more densely substituted, enantioenriched allenyl silanes would react with transfer of axial chirality. Starting materials were created from a racemic secondary alcohol, where an enzymatic chiral resolution gave rise to a complementary pair of enantiomers (Figure 3). Initial studies using the optimized conditions from Table 1 afforded the densely substituted cyclopropane products shown in Figure 4. A series of 2D NMR experiments confirmed the predicted stereochemical outcome of the reaction had occured with good diastereoselectivity. The results of these experiements suggest that carbeneoid transfer favors a concerted mechanism over a 1,3-diradical intermediate, which is prone to racemization. As a direct result, the Ru-carbeneoid must predominantly exist in the singlet state.</p>
      <p>With encouraging initial results, this project could be continued in a number of ways. For example, the substrate scope of the allenylsilane and diazoacetate components could be further explored, and the electronic properties of the phenyl ring in the Ru(II)-Pheox could be modulated via substitution to better align with this particular reaction. This project was inherited by a graduate student in the Panek lab and is ongoing.</p>

      <h3>Asymmetric Propargylation of Carbonyls (Boston University)</h3>
      <p> In the fall of my senior year, I independently worked on developing a catalytic asymmetric propargylation of allenylsilanes. The allenylsilane reagents developed by the Panek group have a reactivity-enhancing beta-Si group, which results in greater electron density and enhanced nucleophilicity of the alleneâ€™s terminal olefin. The goal was to produce enantioenriched propargylic alcohols from achiral allenylsilanes in the presence of a transition metal Lewis acid and a chiral ligand. The project was initiated by screening Pybox ligands with Sc(OTf)3 in the reaction of achiral allenysilanes with ethyl glyoxalate. </p>
      <p>Parameters such as temperature, catalyst loading, and solvent were explored. After exhaustively searching the design space, the reaction did not proceed as expected. There are several factors that could have contributed to this result. All trials were conducted outside of an inert atmosphere glove-box. The ambient atmosphere could have adulterated the Sc(OTf)\textsubscript{3}, thus eliminating catalytic activity. <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja011983i">Similar reactions</a> have been performed inside a glove-box, possibly to avoid this complication. Furthermore, the presence of excess Lewis basic ester functionality in the allene and ethyl glyoxalate may have sequestered Sc(OTf)3.</p>

      <h3>Converegent Synthesis of Novel Muramyl Dipeptide Analogues (Boston University)</h3>
      <p>After joining the Panek lab at BU during my junior year, I began working on a medicinal chemistry project with a graduate student. The objective of this project was to efficiently explore the structure activity relationship  of novel muramyl dipeptide (MDP) analogues by developing a convergent synthetic route. </p>
      <p>This class of molecules dampens the pro-inflammatory signalling pathway in Porphyromona gingivalis, suggesting possible therapeutic benefit to chronic inflammatory conditions. The muramyl dipeptides are consistent of an N-acetyl glucosamine fragment tethered to a Glu-Ala dipeptide fragment by a short alkyl linker. It was my responsibility to optimize the glucosamine fragment synthesis as follows: anomeric benzylation, acetal protection, and O-alkylation. The biological activity was found to be sensitive to the identity of the acetal protecting group as well as any functionality in the O-alkylation partner. Together with another undergraduate researcher, I created a final product that was effective in reducing inflammation induced by septic shock in mice. My contributions to this project were acknowledged in a <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00681">recent publication</a>. </p>
